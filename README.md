# Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Date created
July 6th 2024

### Description
In this project, I wrote an interactive python script that analyzes and displays raw and/or filtered data obtained from CSV files that contain the data for bike share systems from 3 cities in the the United States (*Chicago, New York City, and Washington*).

### Files used
The Python script file:
- [bikeshare.py](./bikeshare.py)

The data files referenced in the script:
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

### Credits
I used the template provided in the `Introduction to Python` lesson which is a **Core Lesson** for the `Programming for Data Science with Python` nanodegree, and made the necessary changes to get the final [python script](./bikeshare.py).
